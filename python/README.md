loveletters
===========

     My  rapture  pants for your unsatisfied appetite.  My seductive adoration  attracts your winning infatuation.  My  affection passionately clings to your amorous fellow feeling.  My  longing fervently longs for your  passion. You are my loving rapture.
     Yours tenderly,
     M.U.C.
